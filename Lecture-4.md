## Last lecture recap

in our last lecture we have categorized pumps to *positive displacement* and *dynamic pump*  we use the positive displacement in the fluid power system because of its ability to withstand high pressures  ** $Q$ =  constant *an advantage* which resulted in a disadvantage : "which is pressure can go up until failure" **  so we protect it with *relief valve*.
