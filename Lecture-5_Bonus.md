>	+ **Another Question**
>		+ if the directional control valve is ** spool  type** it could have internal leakage so check valve will solve this partially.

>+ **Ans3**
>	+ the directional control valve **must have a third position ** to keep the load lifted at its position, where theses two positions in the drawing will extend and retract only.
>+ the check valve will be attached directly to the cylinder not via hoses as it is in this drawing for safety.
