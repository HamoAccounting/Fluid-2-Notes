> + **Ans1**
> 	+ they are the same thing, what determines the direction is the pressure, **this symbol is wrong**
> 	+ put there exists 2/2 valves in the market.

>in two stage pilot-actuated why we put solenoid and hydraulic valve ?
>---
>+ **Ans3**
>	+  if there is high power which needs large valves the solenoid will activate the hydraulic valve which could move the large valve.
>	+ **Why do we need large valve ?**
>		+ due **high flowrate** mainly and load.

>+ **Ans4**
>	+ on the right $P$ connected to $A$ resulted in extension while on the left side it's retraction.

>---
>+ **Ans5**
>	+ the idea is that what determines the motion of the cylinder is the force.
>		+ **cylinder move due to force not pressure *(pressure is the same without losses)* **.
>	+ it was entering $Q_{pump}$ after this modification more $Q_{return}$ is entering which will **INCREASE** ** the **velocity** of extension.
